## Classes

There are 3 classes in Apryx Online.
- Knight
- Mage
- Ranger

### Knight
The knight is a melee fighter who wears heavy armor. The armor is made defend against heavy physical attacks and to deflect arrows from __Rangers__.

### Mage
The mage uses magic to penitrate the oponents defences and deal tonnes of damage. The mage has cloth armor, to power its magic. Because he needs to channel his magic, the mage usually isn't very mobile. Which makes him strong against melee targets, like the __Knight__.

### Ranger
The ranger takes advantage of mobility and range to take down his oponents. He rapidly fires many arrows and dodges his foos. Strong against __Mage__.
